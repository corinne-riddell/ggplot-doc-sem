# Publication-ready plots with ggplot

This is the repository of code and data I use as part of a lecture on making publication ready plots using ggplot2. 

I presented this lecture at: 
* Epidemiology Doctoral Seminar. April 4, 2019. UC Berkeley.
* Epidemiology/Biostatistics Master's Capstone Seminar. October 7, 2020. UC Berkeley.
